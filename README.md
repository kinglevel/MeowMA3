# MeowMA3
Modern vegas mode

This showfile will meow your MA hardware.

It needs real MA hardware in your session to work because of unlocked attributes, Console, Vizkey or a OnPc wing...

If you want audio from the console you will need a S/PDIF DAC.

### HOW TO RUN IT:

Open the showfile, press meow.

To stop, press the meow.
